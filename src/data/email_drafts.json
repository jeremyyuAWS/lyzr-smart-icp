I came across the news about your partnership with Salesforce and your focus on enterprise workflow automation.\n\nI noticed you're actively hiring React developers and expanding your engineering team. At [Your Company], we've helped similar B2B SaaS companies like yours scale their development operations while maintaining code quality and security standards.\n\nGiven your background at Stripe and the technical challenges of building enterprise-grade automation platforms, I'd love to share how we've helped companies in similar growth phases:\n\n• Accelerated development cycles by 40% through automated code review\n• Reduced security vulnerabilities by 60% with integrated security scanning\n• Improved team collaboration across distributed engineering teams\n\nWould you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to discuss how this might apply to TechFlow's current scaling challenges?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
